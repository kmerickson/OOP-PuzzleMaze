## Abstract:
Chip's Core Escape

Chip’s Core Escape is an object-oriented Python game that immerses players inside a giant computer, where they must navigate through a maze filled with puzzles inspired by logic gates, memory storage, and computer architecture. Designed with a custom graphical user interface (GUI), the game provides an interactive gameplay experience. Players take on the role of "Chip," a digital explorer trapped within a malfunctioning system. To progress through each level, they must solve puzzles based on fundamental computing principles—such as binary operations, circuit logic, and data pathways—while navigating the maze. Each successfully completed challenge unlocks new sections of the computer system, bringing Chip one step closer to escaping. The game leverages object-oriented programming (OOP) principles to ensure modularity and scalability, allowing for easy expansion with additional levels and mechanics. Chip’s Core Escape serves as both an entertaining and educational experience, reinforcing computational thinking skills while challenging problem-solving abilities. This project showcases the integration of software design principles, game development, and computer science fundamentals, demonstrating how OOP concepts can be applied to create an interactive and educational gaming experience.
